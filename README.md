# CypressTesting

Testing Angular Material Sidenav Animation problem

## How to reproduce

1. Run in console `npm i`
2. Run in console `npm start`
3. Run in console `npm run cypress-test`
4. Test `animations.spec.js` file;

Notice that each test generates 2 files:
  - `test-open-sidenav-screenshot({number}).png`:
  This one is generated by `cy.snapshot` and if you compare with other files, might hape a small diff;
  - `test-open-sidenav.diff.png`:
  This one is generated by `cy.matchImageSnapshot`, that gets the diff between two images (the current screenshot of the test and the saved one)
